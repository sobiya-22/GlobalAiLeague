Here's a summary of key IPL 2021 trends:

*   **Batting Dominance:** High scores were common, indicating pitches favored batsmen.
*   **Pace over Spin:** Fast bowlers generally outperformed spinners, especially in the death overs.
*   **Strong Openers:** Teams with consistent opening partnerships tended to perform better.
*   **Dew Factor:** Dew significantly impacted second innings, often favoring teams batting second.
*   **Bubble Fatigue:** The bio-bubble environment took a toll, with some players struggling mentally and physically.
*   **Captaincy Impact:** Captains who could adapt strategies based on conditions and player form had more success.
*   **Emergence of New Talent:** Several uncapped Indian players made significant contributions.
*   **Strategic Timeout Usage:** Effective use of strategic timeouts for tactical adjustments proved crucial.

Keep in mind that the season was split into two legs (India and UAE) which could have influenced some of these trends.
